My replication package for my STA 145 class is the population of USA governors from 2000s to present time being analyzed to see if they are impacted by education level when choosing a party/political affiliation.

Data
The data used for this project consists of information on U.S. state governors from the 2000s to the present. Each observation represents an individual governor.

The dataset was originally compiled as part of a group class assignment. Information was collected from multiple publicly available online sources and combined into a single table.

The purpose of this analysis is to examine whether a governor’s education level is associated with their political party affiliation.
Operationalization

Education level was operationalized as the highest completed level of education for each governor, as recorded in the dataset.

Political party affiliation was treated as a categorical variable indicating the governor’s party (e.g., Democratic,Republican or independent).

Education level was used as the main explanatory variable, while political party affiliation was used as the outcome of interest. All variables were coded consistently across observations.
