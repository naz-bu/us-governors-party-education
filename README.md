STA 145 - Final-Project

My replication package for my STA 145 class is the population of USA governors from 2000s to present time being analyzed to see if they are impacted by education level when choosing a party/political affiliation. 
Instructions
To access and utilize the script, open the file Buzugbn1-final_project.R, which contains all code used for this project.
To access the dataset, open Copy of Table Templates file-Data table tabular(1).csv.

Data
The data used for this project consists of information on U.S. state governors from the 2000s to the present. Each observation represents an individual governor.

The dataset was originally compiled as part of a group class assignment. Information was collected from multiple publicly available online sources and combined into a single table.

The purpose of this analysis is to examine whether a governor’s education level is associated with their political party affiliation.
Operationalization

Education level was operationalized as the highest completed level of education for each governor, as recorded in the dataset.

Political party affiliation was treated as a categorical variable indicating the governor’s party (e.g., Democratic,Republican or independent).

Education level was used as the main explanatory variable, while political party affiliation was used as the outcome of interest. All variables were coded consistently across observations.

Analysis
The analysis was conducted using R. The script includes:

Importing the dataset

Cleaning and formatting variables

Descriptive statistics summarizing education levels and party affiliation

Appropriate statistical analysis to examine the relationship between education level and political party affiliation

Visualizations to aid interpretation of results

All analysis steps are clearly labeled in the script.

Output

Running the script produces summary statistics and visualizations that display patterns between governors’ education levels and their political party affiliations. All results are generated directly from the provided code and data.
